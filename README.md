# Deploy React App

Watch this space for a new tool that makes it easier than ever to create **and** deploy a new full-stack [React](https://reactjs.org/) app.

`deploy-react-app` will combine all the goodness of [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) with [AdaptJS](https://adaptjs.org/), making it simple to test and deploy **all** the components of your full-stack app, whether locally on your laptop for end-to-end testing or for production in your favorite cloud.

If you're looking for full-stack app creation and deployment right away, check out the Adapt [Getting Started Guide](https://adaptjs.org/docs/getting_started/).
It walks you through creation of a full-stack React project that has a Node.js API backend and a PostgreSQL database.
